ðŸ”§ Features:
Local Python terminal interface
OpenAI API querying
Modular architecture (memory, config, echo)
Easy to expand (GUI, TTS, agents, etc.)

Requirements:
Python, 3+ (enable PATH checkbox)
System requirements are probably low depending on what you're planning to implement.
MAKE SURE you add your API code to the config.json, This is not standalone and uses API keys to function.

Notes:
Highly scalable and modular, this is the main tie in for AI on your system,
Unfortunately its a pain to get your trained model to local from Chat-GPT
(why I was doing this) But I'm working on that now.
If you use this shell or add modules please contact me with your work.
